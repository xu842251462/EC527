/*
  As described in the clock_gettime manpage (type "man clock_gettime" at the
  shell prompt), a "timespec" is a structure that looks like this:
 
        struct timespec {
          time_t   tv_sec;   // seconds
          long     tv_nsec;  // and nanoseconds
        };
 */

  struct timespec temp;
  if ((end.tv_nsec-start.tv_nsec)<0) {
    temp.tv_sec = end.tv_sec-start.tv_sec-1;
    temp.tv_nsec = 1000000000+end.tv_nsec-start.tv_nsec;
  } else {
    temp.tv_sec = end.tv_sec-start.tv_sec;
    temp.tv_nsec = end.tv_nsec-start.tv_nsec;
  }
  return temp;
}
/*
     This method does not require adjusting a #define constant

  How to use this method:

      struct timespec time_start, time_stop;
      clock_gettime(CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, &time_start);
      // DO SOMETHING THAT TAKES TIME
      clock_gettime(CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, &time_stop);

      NOTE: calling the diff() function to determine the measurement
            is left as an exercise for the student
